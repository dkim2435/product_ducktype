## Typing Speed Reference

- Beginner: below 30 WPM
- Average: 40-50 WPM
- Above Average: 60-75 WPM
- Fast: 80-100 WPM
- Professional: 100-130 WPM
- Expert: 130+ WPM

The average office worker types around 40 WPM. With 10-15 minutes of daily practice, most people can reach 80+ WPM within a few months.

## WPM Calculation

WPM = (correct characters / 5) / (elapsed time in minutes). Each "word" is standardized to 5 characters including spaces for fair cross-language comparison.
