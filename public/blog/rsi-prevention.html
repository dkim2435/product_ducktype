      <h1>RSI Prevention Tips for Typists</h1>
      <p class="meta">Published February 12, 2026 &middot; 5 min read</p>

      <p>If you spend hours typing every day, whether for work, school, or simply because you love a good typing test, your hands and wrists are under more stress than you might realize. Repetitive Strain Injury, commonly known as RSI, is one of the most widespread occupational health issues in the modern world. The good news is that RSI is largely preventable. In this guide, we will cover exactly what RSI is, how to spot the early warning signs, and practical strategies to keep your hands healthy for years of comfortable typing.</p>

      <h2>What Is RSI?</h2>
      <p>RSI stands for Repetitive Strain Injury, an umbrella term for pain and damage caused by repetitive movements and sustained awkward postures. When you type, your fingers, wrists, and forearms perform thousands of micro-movements each hour. Over time, these repetitive motions can inflame tendons, compress nerves, and strain muscles. RSI is not a single condition but a family of related disorders, each affecting different parts of the upper body.</p>

      <h3>Common Types of RSI</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Carpal Tunnel Syndrome:</strong> The most well-known form of RSI. It occurs when the median nerve, which runs through a narrow passageway in the wrist called the carpal tunnel, becomes compressed. Symptoms include tingling, numbness, and weakness in the thumb, index, and middle fingers.</li>
        <li><strong>Tendinitis:</strong> Inflammation of the tendons, typically in the wrist or forearm. Typing with bent wrists or excessive force can irritate the tendons over time, causing pain and stiffness.</li>
        <li><strong>Tennis Elbow (Lateral Epicondylitis):</strong> Despite the name, this condition is common among heavy computer users. It causes pain on the outside of the elbow due to overuse of the forearm muscles that extend the wrist and fingers.</li>
        <li><strong>De Quervain's Tenosynovitis:</strong> Affects the tendons on the thumb side of the wrist. Frequent use of the space bar or trackpad with the thumb can contribute to this condition.</li>
        <li><strong>Trigger Finger:</strong> A condition where a finger gets stuck in a bent position due to inflammation in the tendon sheath. While less common from typing alone, it can develop alongside other RSI conditions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Warning Signs You Should Not Ignore</h2>
      <p>RSI develops gradually, which is part of what makes it so dangerous. Many people dismiss early symptoms as minor fatigue. By the time the pain becomes severe, significant damage may already be done. Watch for these warning signs:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent aching or soreness in your hands, wrists, forearms, or elbows after typing</li>
        <li>Tingling or numbness in your fingers, especially at night</li>
        <li>Weakness in your grip, such as difficulty opening jars or holding objects</li>
        <li>Stiffness in your fingers or wrists when you wake up in the morning</li>
        <li>Sharp pain that shoots from your wrist up your forearm</li>
        <li>A noticeable decrease in your typing speed or accuracy due to discomfort</li>
        <li>Swelling or warmth around your wrist or elbow joints</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you experience any of these symptoms consistently for more than a week, it is time to take action. Do not wait until the pain becomes debilitating.</p>

      <h2>Ergonomic Setup: Your First Line of Defense</h2>
      <p>The way your workstation is arranged has an enormous impact on RSI risk. An ergonomic setup keeps your body in a neutral, relaxed position so that no single joint or muscle group is under excessive strain.</p>

      <h3>Chair and Desk Height</h3>
      <p>Your chair should be adjusted so your feet rest flat on the floor and your thighs are parallel to the ground. Your desk height should allow your forearms to be roughly parallel to the floor when typing. If your desk is too high, your shoulders will hunch upward. If it is too low, your wrists will bend at an uncomfortable angle.</p>

      <h3>Keyboard and Mouse Position</h3>
      <p>Place your keyboard directly in front of you, close enough that you do not have to reach forward. Your elbows should stay close to your body at roughly a 90-degree angle. The keyboard should be flat or slightly tilted away from you. Raising the back of the keyboard, which many people do with the flip-out feet, actually increases wrist extension and strain.</p>

      <h3>Monitor Placement</h3>
      <p>Position your monitor at arm's length, with the top of the screen at or slightly below eye level. This prevents you from hunching forward or craning your neck, which can contribute to upper back and shoulder tension that radiates down to your arms.</p>

      <h2>The 20-20-20 Rule</h2>
      <p>One of the simplest and most effective habits you can adopt is the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. While this rule was originally designed to reduce eye strain, it serves double duty as a reminder to briefly pause your typing, relax your hands, and reset your posture. Consider extending this into a micro-break where you drop your hands to your sides and gently shake them out.</p>

      <h2>Stretches and Exercises for Healthy Hands</h2>
      <p>Regular stretching can dramatically reduce your RSI risk. Try to perform these stretches every hour or two during extended typing sessions:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Wrist Extension Stretch:</strong> Extend one arm in front of you with the palm facing up. Use your other hand to gently pull the fingers back toward your body. Hold for 15 to 20 seconds, then switch hands.</li>
        <li><strong>Wrist Flexion Stretch:</strong> Extend one arm with the palm facing down. Use your other hand to gently press the fingers toward your body. Hold for 15 to 20 seconds per side.</li>
        <li><strong>Finger Spread:</strong> Spread your fingers as wide as possible, hold for 5 seconds, then make a tight fist. Repeat 10 times. This helps counteract the curled finger position from typing.</li>
        <li><strong>Prayer Stretch:</strong> Press your palms together in front of your chest with fingers pointing upward. Slowly lower your hands while keeping them pressed together until you feel a stretch in your wrists and forearms. Hold for 20 seconds.</li>
        <li><strong>Forearm Rotation:</strong> Extend your arm with your elbow at your side. Slowly rotate your forearm so your palm faces up, then down. Repeat 10 times per arm.</li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Proper Typing Technique</h2>
      <p>How you type matters just as much as how long you type. Poor technique forces certain muscles and tendons to work much harder than necessary.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Float your wrists:</strong> Your wrists should hover above the keyboard, not rest on the desk or a wrist rest while actively typing. Wrist rests are for resting between bursts of typing, not for supporting your wrists during typing.</li>
        <li><strong>Type with light pressure:</strong> You do not need to hammer the keys. Modern keyboards require very little force to register a keystroke. Typing with less force significantly reduces strain on your tendons.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep your wrists straight:</strong> Avoid bending your wrists up, down, or to the side. Your fingers should reach for the keys while your wrists remain in a neutral position.</li>
        <li><strong>Use all your fingers:</strong> Touch typing distributes the workload across all ten fingers. Hunt-and-peck typing overloads a few fingers and forces your wrists into awkward angles as you reach across the keyboard.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ergonomic Keyboards and Mice</h2>
      <p>If you type heavily every day, investing in ergonomic peripherals can make a significant difference. Split keyboards like the Kinesis Advantage or ZSA Moonlander allow your hands to rest at shoulder width, eliminating the inward wrist angle that standard keyboards force. Tented keyboards raise the center to reduce forearm pronation. Vertical mice keep your forearm in a neutral handshake position rather than the twisted palm-down position of traditional mice.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>You do not have to spend a fortune right away. Even a simple wrist rest for break times, a keyboard tray to correct your desk height, or switching to a lighter-touch keyboard can make a noticeable difference.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2>Taking Breaks: The Most Underrated Strategy</h2>
      <p>No ergonomic setup can fully compensate for typing without breaks. Your muscles and tendons need regular recovery time. Follow these guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Take a 5 to 10 minute break every hour to stand, stretch, and move around</li>
        <li>Alternate between typing tasks and non-typing tasks throughout the day</li>
        <li>Use voice dictation software for long-form writing when possible</li>
        <li>Set timer reminders if you tend to lose track of time while typing</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to See a Doctor</h2>
      <p>If your symptoms persist despite making ergonomic changes and taking regular breaks, consult a healthcare professional. Early intervention is critical with RSI. A doctor may recommend physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, splinting, or in severe cases, surgery. Do not self-diagnose or rely on internet advice alone if you are experiencing real pain. The earlier RSI is treated, the better the outcome.</p>

      <h2>Long-Term Typing Health</h2>
      <p>Think of RSI prevention as an ongoing practice rather than a one-time fix. Just as athletes warm up before training and cool down afterward, typists should prepare their hands for work and give them proper recovery time. Stay physically active outside of work, as general fitness improves blood circulation to your extremities and strengthens supporting muscles. Pay attention to what your body tells you, and never try to type through pain.</p>
